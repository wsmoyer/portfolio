              I love anything to do with being creative and I am also very
              interested in how things work. I am somebody who likes to learn
              things and I often find myself teaching myself a wide variety of
              things. I don’t like to leave things unfinished and sometimes I
              get stressed out when I can’t finish something right away. Some of
              the things that I value the most are hard work and honesty. If I
              am going to be honest the things that I am not the best at are
              communication. I can get my ideas across to other people and work
              well with others but sometimes I know I could have expressed
              myself better to other people. One of the people I most admire is
              my sister. She is a person who always does the right thing and is
              always honest. She is probably the person I most try to model my
              behavior after. I suppose the thing that makes me the most angry
              is when people lie. I don’t think this is something that is ever
              necessary and I try to avoid people who are liars. I like to watch
              shows to relax like most people, but honestly sometimes doing work
              does relax me because I know I will have the weight of that work
              lifted off me. I would say I am a pretty relaxed person and
              overall I work well under pressure.
