            ><br />
            My university capstone project consisted of creating a website for
            Gibbs Magnet Elementary in Little Rock, Arkansas. I was part of a
            team of 4 people, including myself. My role in the group was project
            leader. My responsibilities were to organize my team, delegate tasks
            to them, and communicate with the client. Gibbs didn’t have their
            own site already so we had to create a whole new site. We used a
            Wordpress pre-built theme for this project. We chose a theme that
            was very customizable so that we could make it fit the client’s
            needs. One of the most difficult parts of the project was figuring
            out how to make a blog post automatically when the google calendar
            had a new event on it. The way we were finally able to do this was
            by using Zapier. With Zapier we could trigger a new blog post to
            appear in the recent news category whenever an event appeared on the
            calendar. This will be way easier for our client since they won´t
            have to worry about creating new blog posts all the time. Also,
            since we were able to set the category for the new blog posts
            automatically, they will show up in the slider on the front page.
            One of the things I learned from working with my team is that task
            delegation is very important for organization and increasing your
            productivity. However, I did enjoy working in a team. As a team we
            came up with ideas that I probably wouldn't have thought of on my
            own. We were also able to complete a project of a larger scope than
            I would have been able to do on my own. The thing I would do
            differently if I could go back and do the project over again is
            experiment with different layouts. As a team, we quickly chose a
            theme that was customizable and suitable for our clients´needs.
            However, we didn´t evaluate other theme options after that and I
            would be curious to see how it would have turned out.
