            I love anything to do with being creative and I am also very
            interested in how things work. I am somebody who likes to learn
            things and I often find myself teaching myself a wide variety of
            things. I don’t like to leave things unfinished and sometimes I get
            stressed out when I can’t finish something right away. Some of the
            things that I value the most are hard work and honesty. If I am
            going to be honest the things that I am not the best at are
            communication. I can get my ideas across to other people and work
            well with others but sometimes I know I could have expressed myself
            better to other people. One of the people I most admire is my
            sister. She is a person who always does the right thing and is
            always honest. She is probably the person I most try to model my
            behavior after. I suppose the thing that makes me the most angry is
            when people lie. I don’t think this is something that is ever
            necessary and I try to avoid people who are liars. I like to watch
            shows to relax like most people, but honestly sometimes doing work
            does relax me because I know I will have the weight of that work
            lifted off me. I would say I am a pretty relaxed person and overall
            I work well under pressure.
